3/7 @ 4am: Added bump stop, unfortunately requires TExaS and CortexM to function - Tyler

3/6 @ 7pm: Added lost counter, and tweaked lost state and center state pwm

3/6 @ 12am: Added Bump and BatterySave, compiles correctly, don't know if it breaks the bot. If it does we can comment it out for now - Tyler

3/5 @ 6pm: Added scaling for PWM and delay for all states, added error tracking for increased resolution for error states

3/5 @ 11:40am: Added more interpreter states for edge cases, altered some PWM values for tighter turning --- oops got rid of overlapping cases - Kushal

3/5 @ 10:30am: Deleted extraneous files and integrated into raceInit, fixed some FSM States delay - Kushal

3/4 @ 11pm: Added MotorsRun, plus functioning code with some corner accuracy issues - Oday & Tyler

3/4 @ 8:30pm: Fixed switch cases and include statements across all files - Kushal

3/4 @ 6pm: Created files for hardware timer motor control, ask me if you need explanantion, but the lab 13 main code is a goood way to test this stuff out - Oday

3/4 @ 6:30pm: integrated PWM & motors into RaceMode

3/4 @ 12pm: Reduced 32 bit values in FSM table to 16 bit to save memory - Tyler

3/4 @ 11am: Added interpreter function, changed FSM to add default ignore input for when the line sensors read something that we want to ignore --> made that the 0x00 input to the FSM - Tyler

3/3: Added Reflance_Read & line sensor initializations in RaceMode_Init - Kushal

3/1: Created baseline files & uploaded - Tyler
